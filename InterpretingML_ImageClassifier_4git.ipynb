        "1.   **My thoughts on Explainable AI**: Interpretable AI sounds like a very useful tool to have in my toolbox specially when I am working with machine learning and deep learning models that inherently are not interperatble and the end user can not understand why the model made specific decisions. Interperatble AI is very important for ensuring transparancy, accountablity and trust in AI models. It can be used to address ethical concerns and assists in regulatory compliance. It also can be used to debug and improve AI models.   \n",
        "2.   **Which method do I agree with most?**: In this study I used three different explainers: SHAP, LIME, and Integrated Gradients. SHAP, LIME, and Integrated Gradients offer different approaches to explaining image classifier models. All these three explainers are model agnostic however IG is beter suited for deep learning models. Leveraging the visual capabilities of the OmniXAI I was able to compare the score maps of these three explainares. Based on my observation LIME and IG are easier to interpret and understand by an end user as the depicted influential pixels clearly can be related to the shape of a pickup truck/car. However, it is hard to arrive at the same conclusion using the shap's score map, as it seems that shap is more faithful to the original model and score the whole image area quite similarly (the green dots are spread all around the score map/image). This make the shap a less interpretable explainer as the user will have no clue why the model made the final decision. Between the three explainers tested in this experience I would vote against the SHAP explainer.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **IS RESNET doing a good job on detecting the cars?** Yes, the RESNET architecture is able to make sound predictions for the car images that we test in the experince. Using the explainers I can see that the model is able to identify important features of the images that correspond to a car such as windshield, side mirros, fender, etc. The model is also able to adequately box and locate the actual car inside the big image.\n",
